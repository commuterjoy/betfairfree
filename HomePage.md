There are some basic docs here, don't forget the README in the root directory
and also we now have a [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/betfairfree), let us know how you use it and any questions you've got.

  * [ExampleApplication](ExampleApplication.md) Example application code using betfairfree
  * [Dependencies](Dependencies.md) Things you need to run the code
  * [Execution](Execution.md) Notes on how to work with the code.
