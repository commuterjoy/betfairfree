
Getting started 
===============

Get hold of the Betfair API document, it's full of useful info

http://bdp.betfair.com/exchdevelopers.php

This code current supports version 5 of the Betfair API

/lib contains the Betfair modules and xpath modules.

/conf contains some yaml files in various stages of development, including the 
default.yml where debug can be turned on and off and the connect URIs are set

/tmpl contains the soap templates for sending. These are processed by 
BetFair::Template using a HTML::Template to fill them in. 

See BetFair::Template for a list of what templates are available and therefore 
what commands are currently supported by betfairfree. If you write support for 
additional commands feel free to submit them back.

/_t contains various perl scripts that can be used for workng out what does what, 

quite a good first port of call, it will (naturally) check your library 
dependencies and try to get a API session using your betfair.com login details.

 perl -I./lib _t/session.pl -u username -p password

check your available balance

 perl -I./lib _t/getAccountFunds.pl -u username -p password

log a market's best prices, every 10 seconds

 perl -I./lib _t/log_best_prices.pl -u username -p password -interval 10 -m marketid

I'd start with getMarket.pl which returns market info when given login details 
and a market id. you can then search that for a selection and combine that with 
getMarketPrices to track the prices for an individual selection.

An example of how to use the code in a running script is given below.

/docs contains the example responses from Betfair.

Example Code
============

# lets get the betfair session - 82 is the free api product code
my $s = new BetFair::Session({  username => 'foo',  password => 'bar',  productId => 82 }  );

# setup the template and request engines
my $t = new BetFair::Template;
my $r = new BetFair::Request;

# pass the parameters into the getMarket Template
my $message = $t->populate( 'getMarket', { session => $s->{key}, marketId => $marketid } );

# make the request
$r->message( $message, 'getMarket' );
$r->request();
my $returnedXML = $r->{response};

# now parse the returned XML to get the selection id of the contender we want to bet on
[code]

# parse the response to get the new betfair params, the session may have changed 
my $x = new BetFair::Parser( { 'message' => $r->{response} } );

# so now we want prices - note that we use the session token returned 
$message = $t->populate( 'getMarketPrices', { session => $x->get_sessionToken(), marketId => $marketid } );
$r->message( $message, 'getMarketPrices' );
$r->request();
$marketpricexml = $r->{response};
$x = new BetFair::Parser( { 'message' => $r->{response} } );

# parse the xml returned for our selection and check that  we're happy with the price
[code]

# So lets place a back bet
$t->populate( 'placeBets', { session => $x->get_sessionToken(), marketId => $marketid, selectionid => $selectionid, price => $betprice, size => $stake ,  
bettype => 'B' } );
$r->message( $message, 'placeBets' );
$r->request();
my $returnedXML = $r->{response};

# parse the XML and make sure we got the bet on
[code]

# crack open the bubbly and wait for the money to roll in :-)

Throttling
==========

The free betfair API is throttled by Betfair, there is a throttling engine 
within this API but it does not keep state between script runs.
