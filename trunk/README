
Getting started 
===============

Get hold of the Betfair API document, it's full of useful info

http://bdp.betfair.com/exchdevelopers.php

Intro to the betfairfree files

/lib contains the Betfair modules and xpath modules.

/conf contains some yaml files in various stages of development, including the 
default.yml where debug can be turned on and off and the connect URIs are set

/_t contains various perl scripts taht can be used for workng out what does what, 

create a session

quite a good first port of call, it will (naturally) check your library 
dependencies and try to get a API session using your betfair.com login details.

 perl -I./lib _t/session.pl -u username -p password

check your available balance

 perl -I./lib _t/getAccountFunds.pl -u username -p password

log a market's best prices, every 10 seconds

 perl -I./lib _t/log_best_prices.pl -u username -p password -interval 10 -m marketid

I'd start with getMarket.pl which returns market info when given login details 
and a market id. you can then search that for  selection and combine that with 
getMarketPrices to track the prices for an individual selection.

/docs contains the example responses

/tmpl contains the soap templates for sending. These are processed by 
BetFair::Template using a HTML::Template to fill them in.

The free betfair API is throttled by Betfair, there is a throttling engine 
within this API but it does not keep state between script runs.
